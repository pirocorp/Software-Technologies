                        <h2>Brexit Not Slowing Hiring at One of U.K.’s Major Tech Firms</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Tech firms have been among the more vocal industries concerned about the impact of Brexit on job creation. But the uncertainty hasn’t put the breaks on ARM Holdings Plc’s hiring spree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Brexit is not slowing down our hiring into the U.K. for the moment," Simon Segars, chief executive officer of ARM, said. "It’s taking a bit longer to get people into the door but we haven’t seen a big slowdown yet."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the last year ARM has increased its headcount by 25 percent, said Segars. There are now over 5,700 employees at the firm, with about 80 percent consisting of technical staff.

                    <p>
                        Britain’s business leaders have relentlessly voiced their concern that the U.K. is lacking clarity about how it will manage the process of leaving the European Union, and Segars added that Brexit is causing continued uncertainty for U.K. businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We don’t know what that will mean," he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ARM was the U.K.’s largest listed tech company before SoftBank Group Corp.’s $32 billion takeover in 2016. Segars said the deal has since led to new discussions with SoftBank’s array of subsidiaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We’re working closely with Sprint Corp. and SoftBank Mobile in Japan, and with some of the other Vision Fund investment companies," he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ARM -- founded in late 1990 -- posted a loss of $200 million for the nine months to Dec. 31, off net sales of $1.4 billion, according to SoftBank’s consolidated results. This loss does not include around $370 million in write-offs of intangible assets following its acquisition by SoftBank.
