                        Eight Conservative Party lawmakers have backed an amendment calling for the U.K. to keep close ties to the European Union after it leaves, an attempt to reverse Theresa May’s Brexit policy that could threaten her political survival.

                    <p>
                        Tech firms have been among the more vocal industries concerned about the impact of Brexit on job creation. But the uncertainty hasn’t put the breaks on ARM Holdings Plc’s hiring spree.

                    <p>
                        "Brexit is not slowing down our hiring into the U.K. for the moment," Simon Segars, chief executive officer of ARM, said. "It’s taking a bit longer to get people into the door but we haven’t seen a big slowdown yet."

                        Will cryptocurrencies usurp central banks' role as monopoly suppliers of money, and what implications would that have for financial stability? Interestingly, a number of different answers to these questions are emerging, as monetary policymakers become either cautious fans or committed foes.

                        LONDON – A few days ago, President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela announced that his government had launched a new state-sponsored cryptocurrency called the petro. He claimed that $735 million worth of the new currency had already been sold, though observers are skeptical, unless state entities have been obliged to buy them. Even they will find it hard to do so, however, as the technology platform on which the petro will be traded has not yet been confirmed.

                        Did February’s equity-price reversal mark the end of the bull market, or was it just a temporary correction? In addressing this question, one must look not just at the stock market, but also at oil prices, long-term US interest rates, and currencies.

                        LONDON – Three months ago, I argued that rising stock markets around the world were a consequence of improving economic conditions, not a sign of “irrational exuberance.” Since that commentary was published, share prices accelerated upward, and some “irrational exuberance” did start to appear, leading to a sharp fall in early February. Although most stock markets are still well above their levels of last November, the question lingers: Did February’s reversal mark the end of the bull market, or was it just a temporary correction?

                    <p>
                        Norway’s sovereign wealth fund says a spike in volatility may well help it with a plan to add almost $40 billion in stocks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the $1 trillion Oslo-based fund works its way toward a long-term allocation target of 70 percent in equities, “increased volatility is as much of an opportunity as a challenge,” Yngve Slyngstad, the chief executive officer of Norges Bank Investment Management, which runs the fund, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
